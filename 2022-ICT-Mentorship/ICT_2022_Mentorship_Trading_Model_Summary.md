## Overview

The ICT (Inner Circle Trader) 2022 Mentorship was a free educational series on YouTube consisting of 41 episodes designed to teach a simplified trading model for index futures. The mentorship was specifically created by Michael J. Huddleston (ICT) for his daughter but shared publicly to help new traders learn price action concepts.

## Core Trading Model Components

### 1. Market Focus
- **Primary Instrument:** NASDAQ E-mini Futures (NQ)
- **Secondary Instruments:** E-mini S&P 500 (ES), E-mini Dow (YM)
- **Approach:** Intraday trading using stripped-down concepts
- **Platform:** Predominantly taught through TradingView paper trading

### 2. Key Concepts

#### A. Fair Value Gaps (FVG)
- **Definition:** Price imbalances between candles where one candle's high doesn't overlap with another candle's low
- **Purpose:** These gaps act as magnets for future price action
- **Usage:** Primary entry mechanism when price returns to fill these gaps
- **Types:** Bullish FVG (for long entries) and Bearish FVG (for short entries)

#### B. Liquidity Pools
- **Buy Side Liquidity:** Orders resting above previous highs (stop losses from shorts, buy stops)
- **Sell Side Liquidity:** Orders resting below previous lows (stop losses from longs, sell stops)
- **Market Manipulation:** Smart money targets these liquidity pools before reversing
- **Identification:** Found at obvious support/resistance levels where retail traders place stops

#### C. Market Structure
- **Higher Highs/Higher Lows:** Bullish market structure
- **Lower Highs/Lower Lows:** Bearish market structure
- **Structure Shifts:** When market breaks previous swing points, indicating trend change
- **Importance:** Determines overall bias and trade direction

#### D. Order Blocks
- **Definition:** The last candle before a strong move that caused the imbalance
- **Function:** Act as supply/demand zones for potential reversals
- **Usage:** Secondary confirmation tool, not the primary entry mechanism
- **Note:** FVGs are more important than order blocks in this model

### 3. Trading Sessions & Timing

#### A. New York Index AM Session (Killzone)
- **Time:** 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM (New York Time)
- **Characteristics:** Highest probability setups
- **Focus:** Primary trading window for the model

#### B. Lunch Hour
- **Time:** 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM (New York Time)
- **Characteristics:** Often consolidation period
- **Approach:** Generally avoided for new setups

#### C. New York Index PM Session
- **Time:** 1:30 PM - 4:00 PM (New York Time)
- **Characteristics:** Secondary trading opportunity
- **Focus:** Post-lunch continuation moves

### 4. The Core Model Process

#### Step 1: Market Bias Determination
1. Identify higher timeframe trend (Daily/4H)
2. Locate nearest liquidity pools (buy-side and sell-side)
3. Determine which liquidity is likely to be targeted first

#### Step 2: Setup Identification
1. Wait for market to move toward targeted liquidity
2. Look for Fair Value Gap formation during the move
3. Wait for price to retrace back into the FVG
4. Confirm market structure supports the direction

#### Step 3: Entry Execution
1. Enter when price trades back into the FVG
2. Target the opposite liquidity pool
3. Use proper risk management (typically 2:1 or better R:R)

#### Step 4: Trade Management
1. Partial profits at logical levels
2. Move stops to breakeven when appropriate
3. Let runners target full liquidity objectives

### 5. Risk Management
- **Position Sizing:** Conservative approach using micro contracts for beginners
- **Stop Losses:** Placed beyond the fair value gap or significant structure
- **Risk-Reward:** Minimum 2:1, often much higher
- **Max Risk:** Typically 2-5 handles on index futures

### 6. Key Rules and Principles

#### Trading Rules:
1. Only trade during specified killzones
2. Always have a pre-defined target (liquidity pool)
3. Never trade without a fair value gap present
4. Respect market structure shifts
5. Don't force trades - wait for proper setups

#### Mindset Principles:
1. Focus on process over profits
2. Expect and accept losing trades
3. Consistency over perfection
4. Paper trade until consistently profitable
5. Develop patience and discipline

### 7. Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Trading Without FVG:** Model requires fair value gap for entry
2. **Ignoring Market Structure:** Don't trade against the trend
3. **FOMO Trading:** Wait for proper setups, don't chase
4. **Over-leveraging:** Start small with micro contracts
5. **Session Timing:** Don't trade outside optimal hours

### 8. Model Limitations and Expectations
- **Not 100% Accurate:** Expect 60-70% win rate at best
- **Learning Curve:** Requires months of practice to master
- **Market Dependent:** Works best in trending/volatile conditions
- **Psychological Challenges:** Requires discipline and emotional control

### 9. Educational Progression

- **Episodes 1-10:** Basic concepts and setup identification
- **Episodes 11-25:** Advanced timing and market reading
- **Episodes 26-35:** Real-time application and case studies
- **Episodes 36-41:** Integration and final concepts

### 10. Key Takeaways
1. **Simplicity:** Stripped-down approach focusing on core concepts
2. **Repeatability:** Model designed to find similar setups consistently
3. **Risk Management:** Emphasis on capital preservation
4. **Patience:** Quality over quantity in trade selection
